Student Performance Prediction

This project uses an AI model trained on data from 343 students to predict whether a student is likely to fail based on various personal characteristics such as age, sex, study time, the time they spend outside, and the time they waste on the internet.
Features

    Age: The age of the student.
    Sex: The gender of the student.
    Study Time: The amount of time the student spends studying.
    Time Spent Outside: The amount of time the student spends outdoors.
    Time Wasted on Internet: The amount of time the student spends on non-productive internet activities.
    

Libraries Used

This project utilizes several Python libraries for data processing, analysis, and visualization:

    Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
    Numpy: For numerical computations.
    Seaborn: For data visualization.
    Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the machine learning model.
    Matplotlib: For creating various plots to visualize the data.

Data Visualization

To enhance the understanding of the data, I created various graphs using the Matplotlib library. These visualizations help in comprehending the patterns and relationships within the data more clearly.
